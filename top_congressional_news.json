Newsom Pushes To Redraw Maps To Counter Texas Republicans","shortDescription":"California Governor Gavin Newsom has unveiled a high-stakes plan to redraw voting districts in his state to counter similar efforts by Republicans in Texas.\nNewsom announced that California would hold a special election in November, in which voters would be asked to approve a mid-decade redistricting plan ahead of the 2026 national midterms.\n Newsom characterized the move as an emergency measure in response to a President Donald Trump-backed plan in Texas, which could allow Republicans to gain five more seats in the House. \nAnnouncing the plan at the Japanese American National Museum’s National Center for the Preservation of Democracy, Newsom vowed the move would “neuter and neutralize” Texas’s plan. \n“We're working through a very transparent, temporary, and public process. We're putting the maps on the ballot and empowering the people. We must recognize the cards we have been dealt and meet fire with fire,” Newsom said. \nIf successful, Newsom’s plan would allow California to retain its current congressional maps if Texas and other states withdraw from any changes.\nThe move comes amid ongoing Republican-led redistricting efforts in Florida and Ohio, as well as discussions to do the same in Indiana and Missouri.\nRepublicans in Texas have so far been blocked from approving new maps as House Democrats fled the state, preventing the chamber from reaching a quorum to proceed with a vote. \nTexas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to arrest the Texas Democrats for fleeing, vowing to hold continuous special legislative sessions until the proposal passes.","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/2025/08/20/gov-newsom-pushes-to-redraw-maps-to-counter-texas-republicans/85672379007/","source":"USA Today","slug":"usatoday","imageUrl":"","date":"2025/08/20"}]
